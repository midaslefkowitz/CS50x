0.  BMP = 2^32, GIF = 2^24, JPEG 2^24, PNG = 2^24
1.  GIF
2.  Lossless compression means that when compressed the file does not lose any quality. Lossy means that compression causes a loss of quality.
3.  JPEG is lossy
4.  The OS marks the directory as safe to use. It also adds those clusters to the list of empty clusters
5.  Overwrite with all zeroes, or even better with a "Guttman pattern".
6.  It contains the definitions of several new integer types to enhance the portability of programs.
7.  Since they are guaranteed to be the same size across all machines this ensures that the new image will be the appropriate size.
8.  BYTE = 8 bits (1 byte). DWORD = 32 bits (4 bytes). LONG = 32 bits (4 bytes). WORD = 16 bits (2 bytes).
9.  0x4D42
10. bfsize = The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. bisize = The number of bytes required by the structure.
11. The bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper left corner.
12. biBitCount
13. If it is unable to create a new bmp to write to (for example: if out of memory)
14. Because it is reading one RGBTRIPLE at a time. 
15. 3.
16. Skips over any padding, if any.
17. It's a constant which represents the current position in the file when used in fseek or fseeko
